# Introduction

## What are dataclasses?

Python dataclasses are a simple way to create Python classes to hold structured data. For example, to create a class to store data related to a planetâ€™s mass:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Planet:
    name: str
    mass_kg: int
    is_dwarf_planet: bool = False
```

Then, to create instances of the `Planet` class, you can provide keyword arguments as folows:

```python
saturn = Planet(name='Saturn', mass_kg=568.34e24)
pluto = Planet(name='Pluto', mass_kg=1.303e22, is_dwarf_planet=True)
```

To access the instance field values, use dot notation, such as:

```python
print(saturn.mass_kg)
```

For more details see the dataclass package documentation: [https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html)

## What is introspection?

Introspection, also called reflection or metaprograming, is a way to programatically inspect the structure of a class.

### Why is this useful?

Applications of introspection include:

* Converting to data structures in other programming languages, such as C/C++ for performance critical code and Dart for building GUIs with Flutter.
* Serialization and deserialization, for example when reading and writing JSON.
* Automatic documentation generation, including class diagrams.
* Form generation.    
* Syntax checkers, highlights and linters.
* ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) when working with databases such as MySQL and PostGres.

# Solar System Example

We are going to create a model of a solar system containing planets.

Let's start with the `Planet` class, with a some fields for storing data about the planets mass and orbit:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from typing import List


@dataclass
class Planet:
    """
    A planet in the solar system.

    Attributes:
        name (str): The name of the planet.
        mass (int): The mass of the planet in kilograms.
        solar_system (SolarSystem): The solar system the planet belongs to.
        is_dwarf_planet (bool): Indicates if the planet is a dwarf planet. Defaults to False.
        semi_major_axis (float): The semi-major axis of the planet's orbit in astronomical units (AU).
        eccentricity (float): The eccentricity of the planet's orbit.
        inclination (float): The inclination of the planet's orbit in degrees.
        orbital_period (float): The orbital period of the planet in Earth years.
    """
    name: str
    mass_kg: float = 0.0
    solar_system: "SolarSystem" = None
    is_dwarf_planet: bool = False
    semi_major_axis: float = 0.0
    eccentricity: float = 0.0
    inclination: float = 0.0
    orbital_period: float = 0.0
```

The `Planet` class contains:
* A description of the class, including any units used. This is important to help developers using this model and for generating documentation.
* A reference to a "SolarSystem" object. The class name is enclosed in double-quotes because we create this class later in the model.

Next we define the `SolarSystem` class:

```python
@dataclass
class SolarSystem:
    """
    A solar system with planets.
    
    Args:
        name (str): The name of the solar system.
        planets (List[Planet]): A list of planets in the solar system.
    """
    name: str
    planets: List[Planet] = field(default_factory=list)

    def add_planet(self, planet: Planet):
        """
        Adds a planet to the solar system and updates the planet's solar_system field.

        Args:
            planet (Planet): The planet to add.
        """
        planet.solar_system = self
        self.planets.append(planet)
```

A `SolarSystem` contains:
* The name of the solar system, which is a required field.
* A list of planets.

The `Planet` class name does not need double quotes because it is already define above this class in the model.

The `planet` field is initalized with a `default_factory` of `list`. You must do this for all lists and dictonaries in a dataclass.

The `add_planet` method is used to add a planet to this solar system, we will see later how this works.

# Introspection methods

* Finding dataclasses in a module
    
    * Name of class
        
    * Inheritance vs encapsulation
        
    * Docstrings
        
* Listing fields of a dataclass
    
* Determining the properties of a field, such as:
    
    * Type
        
    * Lists
        
    * Dicts
        
    * References
        
    * Optional
